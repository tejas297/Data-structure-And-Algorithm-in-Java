# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## 1. Data Structures

### Meaning: A data structure is a way to organize, manage, and store data so it can be used efficiently.

In Java: Data structures are implemented using classes, objects, and interfaces. Java also provides a Collections Framework that gives built-in implementations of many data structures.

### Examples of Data Structures in Java

Arrays → Fixed-size collection of elements

Strings → Sequence of characters (special class in Java)

Linked List → Elements (nodes) connected using pointers

Stack → Follows LIFO (Last In First Out)

Queue / Deque → Follows FIFO (First In First Out)

HashMap / HashSet → Store key-value pairs and unique elements

Tree / Graph → Hierarchical or network structures

## 2. Algorithms

### Meaning: An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

In Java: Algorithms are written as methods/functions using Java’s syntax. They often work on data structures.

### Examples of Algorithms in Java

Searching Algorithms → Linear Search, Binary Search

Sorting Algorithms → Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

Graph Algorithms → BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Dynamic Programming → Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem

Greedy Algorithms → Minimum Spanning Tree, Huffman Coding

## 3. Why Learn DSA in Java?

Java is object-oriented, making it easy to model data structures

Java’s Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue, etc.) saves time

Strong library support (e.g., java.util.*)

Widely used in competitive programming, interviews, and system design
